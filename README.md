# Logistic-Regression-Cat-Classifier
## This is a Logistic Regression classifier that can recognize cats.
- The training dataset is of dimension (209, 64, 64, 3) and the testing dataset is of dimension (50, 64, 64, 3), each with label 0 or 1.
- Initialize w and b with 0 vector and 0
- Run propagation to get dw, db and cost
- Use gradient descent to update w and b for the number of iterations you want
- Use calculated w and b to predict your picture
